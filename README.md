# customer_churn_prediction-analysis

# Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify factors leading to customer attrition and develop predictive models to help businesses retain valuable customers.

# Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes customer information such as demographics, service usage, contract details, and churn status. Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

# Methodology

The analysis follows these key steps:

* Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw data for analysis.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying patterns and relationships in the data.

* Feature Engineering: Selecting and creating meaningful features.

* Model Training & Evaluation: Training machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

* Model Evaluation: Using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics to assess performance.

# Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy
